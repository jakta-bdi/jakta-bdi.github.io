# About JaKtA

JaKtA is a framework for developing Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents using the Kotlin programming language.
It seamlessly integrates object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, providing a robust platform for creating intelligent agents.
JaKtA aims to simplify the development of complex agent-based systems by leveraging Kotlin's modern features and concise syntax.

We are currently working on documentation to help you get started with JaKtA and make the most out of its features. 
In the meantime, you can check the papers describing JaKtA:
