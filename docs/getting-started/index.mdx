# Getting Started 

The best way to use JaKtA is in a Kotlin project, it is the only way you can benefit from its declarative DSL.

### Setup JaKtA

To get started with JaKtA simply create a new project and copy this in your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation("it.unibo.jakta:jakta-dsl:latest")
}
```

<details>
<summary> 
Gradle will import JaKtA as a dependency from **Maven Central**, make sure your gradle configuration is properly setup.
</summary>

To setup Maven Central copy this in your `build.gralde.kts` file:
```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

</details>

### Create a Multi-Agent System 

Create a file and start writing your JaKtA agents within the `main` function:
```
fun main() {
    mas {
     // your MAS definition goes in here
    }.start()
}
```

:::warning[Don't Forget]
Don't forget to put `.start()` at the end! This instruction actually triggers the execution of the `mas` you define. 
:::

### Run your Multi-Agent System

//TODO

<!-- Run your project
<Tabs>
<TabItem value='Linux' default>
```
./gradlew run
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='Windows'>
```
gradlew.bat run
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs> -->

## Start your JaKtA journey

You're all set, you can now explore more about JaKtA and learn how to build multi-agent systems! 

Either continue with a [Hello World](./hello-world.md) example,
or discover more about the main [Basic Concepts](../basic-concepts/index.md) that you will need to implemente BDI agents in JaKtA.
