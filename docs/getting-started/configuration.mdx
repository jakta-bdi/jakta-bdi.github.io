# Configuration

The best way to use JaKtA is in a `Kotlin` project, so that you can benefit from its declarative DSL.

## Prerequisites

You need:
* A terminal, bash compatible preferred
* [Java 11+](https://adoptium.net/) installed and working
    - Java can be downloaded from [https://adoptium.net/](https://adoptium.net/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed and working
    - Git can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com

## Distribution 

JaKtA is distributed on Maven Central.
You can find the project at this [link](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/it.unibo.jakta).

## Setup your JaKtA project

To get started with JaKtA, create a new `gradle` project 
and import the following Maven Central dependency in your `build.gradle.kts` file:

1. Create a new Kotlin project using Gradle:
```bash
mkdir jakta-project
cd jakta-project
gradle init --type kotlin-application
```
2. Add JaKtA dependency in `build.gradle.kts`:
```bash
dependencies {
    implementation("it.unibo.jakta:jakta-dsl:<latest.release>")
}
```

Or, alternatively, use the [JaKta template](https://github.com/jakta-bdi/template-for-JaKtA-project).

:::tip[Versioning]
It is always preferrable to select a fixed version for your dependencies. Check out JaKtA's latest available version [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/it.unibo.jakta/jakta).
